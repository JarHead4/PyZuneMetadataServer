# PyZuneMetadataServer
A recreation of the Zune CD metadata servers in Python.

These services (toc.music.metaservices.microsoft.com and images.metaservices.microsoft.com) were shut down some time in 2019, leaving Zune clients unable to automatically get metadata for inserted CDs.

This project aims to recreate these services, so you can now automatically view and rip CDs to your library with metadata from MusicBrainz.
